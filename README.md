# ad_farmer
This bot was designed to farm the BAT that is given out from advertisements 
on the brave browser

When ads are enabled there is a little ad that pops up ever so often on the browser and you can either choose to open it
 or close it with the button click.
 
 The objective of this program is to open the advertisement click on the page a given amount of times and then close the
  tab out.
